
# LAB: Finding Microsoft Graph commands and permissions

<# TASK

Using the Find-MgGraphCommand and Find-MgGraphPermission cmdlets, find the following information:

1. Can you identify the Microsoft Graph PowerShell command that allows you to modify a group? Use the Find-MgGraphCommand cmdlet to assist you in your search.
2. Once you've found the command, can you determine which permissions are necessary to execute it?
3. Now, let's switch gears a bit. Can you find a command that retrieves the list of appRoleAssignment granted to a service principal?
4. Lastly, let's dive into permissions a bit more. The Application.Read.All permission is often required to run commands in an unattended script. Can you find the identifier for this permission?
